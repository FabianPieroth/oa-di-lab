##################### Reservation ######################################
# Make the reservations via datalab.srv.lrz.de
# You have to put you public SSH key in the profile info
# When making a reservation you need to select the image version with CUDA 9.1 (I never tried the other one)
# You can book reservations directly one after the other ('chaining') 
# and the VM and the scripts you are running will continue.

##################### Copy the data from Toms Linux Cluster Storage to your DSS ######################
# Before doing this, please consider 3 things:
# -> This script only copies everything in di-lab/data, not src!
# -> Files existent on the DSS with the same file names are overwritten
# -> Do you want to delete old/corrupted data in the DSS beforehand?

# log into the linuxcluster:
# ssh LRZ_ID@lxlogin6.lrz.de
# go to Tom's di-lab directory:
cd /home/hpc/pn56xe/di52tig/di-lab
# execute the copy_data_to_the_dss.sh script
./copy_data_to_the_dss.sh

# If you want to have a look at what's in your DSS directory, find it in /dss/dssfs01/pn69za/pn69za-dss-0001/
# cd /dss/dssfs01/pn69za/pn69za-dss-0001/

##################### Log in ######################################
# Once the machine is ready (about 3 min after the reservation time) you get an email with the login info.
# it looks like this: ssh ubuntu@10.155.47.236 (different IP address for you)
# run this command in the terminal. you may be asked to add the fingerprint to the known hosts, do that
# Normally, this should be it, you are logged onto the server.

# For how to deal with the 'man-in-the-middle-attack' error, see the troubleshooting 1.1

##################### Preparation ######################################
# navigate to the server_scripts directory, something like
cd /home/diXXXXX/di-lab/server_scripts
# make the script runnable
chmod u+x installDGX.sh
# run the script
./installDGX.sh
# you will be asked to type yes two times

# after the install, open byobu
byobu

##################### Training ######################################
# navigate to the src directory, somethink like
cd /home/diXXXXX/di-lab/src
# run the script
python3 trainer/trainer_file.py
# don't forget to check the path in the data_loader.py and all the trainer settings
# If you are on the V100, you might have to put
import sys
sys.path.append('thepath')
# on top of the trainer file, thepath being the absolute path to the src directory

# There is no need to copy reports, they are already saved in the dss.

##################### Troubleshooting ######################################
# 1) During Login
# 1.1 Man-in-the-middle-attack-error: 
# I don't know if this is the correct way to deal with this situation, but it worked for me:
# go to your local .ssh directory and delete everything inside the known_hosts file 
# (maybe before that, make a backup copy of the file somewhere else)
# try again to log in

# 2) Downloads
# 2.1 Downloads taking a long time (apt install, docker pull and conda install)
# sometimes it helpt to keyboard interrupt the download and start again
